# Data-Security-in-WBANs-using-Blockchain
A prototype for transferring body vitals information securely from WBAN using blockchain.

In order to simulate what a blockchain-based WBAN would look like, we have simulated a situation where, the data with regard to body vitals such as temperature, EEg, ECG, SPO2, blood pressure are generated via a program, blockchain is used to safely store this data post which it is stored to a cloud database on Thingspeak. The data that has been stored in a private channel on Thingspeak can be accessed only by the use of private API keys. Graphs have been generated to obtain the analysis of the values. A prototype of the  blockchain has been built in Python.
